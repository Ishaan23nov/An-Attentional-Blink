# An-Attentional-Blink

This project is based on two research papers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0042698989901430"> The Combination of motion signal over time </a> and  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21654601_Temporary_Suppression_of_Visual_Processing_in_an_RSVP_Task_An_Attentional_Blink"> Temporary Suppression of Visual Processing in an RSVP Task </a>. Collection of data was done from a bunch of students at IIITD. Where they need to perform a task RSVP task in which they were made to sit in front of computer screens at a particular distance(different for each task) and with the help of an eye tracker their pupil movement was detected. The task was to detect the target(a letter) in a stream of letters where the time difference between two targets were kept constant. </br>

The above RSVP experiment was just a base to our main project. In RSVP the letters are kept stationary but in daily life we encounter objects that are constantly in motion. In the second experiment the participants were shown 2 different objects one after the other both of which were moving in same, opposite or perpendicular direction. At the same time the time difference between both the objects changed in each trial of the experiment.

With this available data we tried to observe/analyse how our human pupil will response in each case.
